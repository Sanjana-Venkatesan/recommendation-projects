# Recommendation Systems Projects

Welcome to the **Recommendation Systems Projects** repository! This collection showcases various recommendation system models tailored to suggest content such as books, movies, and music based on user inputs. Each project demonstrates different approaches to creating recommendation systems, from simple mood-based suggestions to more complex content-based and collaborative filtering techniques.

### Projects Overview:

1. **Image-Based Book Recommendation (`Image_based_book_recommendation.ipynb`)**  
   - This project recommends books to users based on an image. It uses **image analysis** to determine the content of the image, which helps in suggesting books with related themes or genres. This project explores content-based recommendation techniques that integrate computer vision and machine learning.

2. **Movie Recommendation (`Movie_Recommendation.ipynb`)**  
   - A classic movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. This could be based on **genres**, **ratings**, **previously watched movies**, or any other factors. The project can be expanded to include collaborative filtering or deep learning-based models for more personalized recommendations.

3. **Music Recommendation (`Music_Recommendation_.ipynb`)**  
   - This system recommends music tracks or albums to users based on their **mood**, **genre preferences**, or **listening history**. It employs techniques similar to those used in movie recommendation systems, adapting them to the music domain. The project could explore both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering models.

4. **Mood-Based Book Recommendation (`mood_based_book_recommendation.ipynb`)**  
   - A recommendation system that suggests books to users based on their current **mood**. Users can input their mood, and the system will suggest books that match that mood, using natural language processing or sentiment analysis techniques to understand and categorize the mood.

### Technologies Used:
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch
- **Recommendation Algorithms**: Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid approaches
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK, SpaCy
- **Image Analysis**: OpenCV, Pillow (for image-based recommendations)

### Key Features:
- **Mood-Based Recommendations**: Projects like **Mood-Based Book Recommendation** allow users to input their mood and receive personalized content suggestions.
- **Cross-Domain Applications**: The repository covers recommendation systems for books, movies, and music, demonstrating the versatility of recommendation algorithms.
- **Collaborative and Content-Based Approaches**: The projects explore a variety of recommendation techniques, including content-based and collaborative filtering approaches.
- **Data Integration**: Projects combine different data sources such as **text**, **images**, and **user history** to make intelligent recommendations.

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository or download the individual Jupyter notebooks.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Explore the recommendation algorithms used in each notebook and experiment with different datasets.
4. Modify the models or integrate new data to improve recommendation accuracy or tailor them to your own use cases.
